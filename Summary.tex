%Charge: Coordination of the Ground-based GW Community R\&D: develop and facilitate coordination mechanisms among the current and future planned and anticipated ground-based GW projects, including identification of common technologies and R\&D activities as well as comparison of the specific technical approaches to 3G detectors. Including identifying primary (enabling or fundamental) and secondary (or technical) technologies.
%The next generation of gravitational-wave detector will require a tight coordination of R\&D topics. 

\textcolor{red} {In order to accomplish the scientific program of the 3G network, a broad coherent detector R\&D program is needed addressing key technological challenges (new facilities, new lasers, new optical materials, new mirror coatings etc.) in the next 5-7\,years. This report presents the main technological challenges, approaches, timelines, and where possible decision points.}


Third generation facilities will house detectors with sensitivities at least 10 times better that 2G detectors across the audio-band (around 2 to 4\,Hz up to  ~ 10\,kHz), and more than 1000 times better at the lower frequencies (below 30\,Hz).    As with 2G facilities , 3G infrastructure will enable successive generations of detectors to be installed as new technologies and techniques mature.  Whilst there exist different designs and implementations for the first 3G detectors (ET, CE for example), the enabling technologies (substrates, coatings, cryogenics, suspensions, Newtonian noise cancellation, lasers and quantum enhancement) are similar at the research level.  Timely progress in the development of these enabling technologies will require global collaboration and coordination.  

Four areas in particular are of such a scale that global coordination will need to be accompanied by global R\&D funding: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item facility and vacuum infrastructure; 
\item  substrates; 
\item coatings; 
\item large scale prototyping for demonstration of technology readiness. 
\end{enumerate}

Progress in areas 1, 2 and 3 will require significant involvement with industry, with some areas, eg coatings,  potentially requiring the field to build its own plants.

Depending on R\&D progress, the first 3G detectors may adopt technologies proven in 2G facilities, scaled up to much longer baselines. 

\section*{Recommendations}
 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Recommendation 1}:  An international 3G R\&D coordination/oversight committee should be formed, with membership from all regions across the world.
\item \textbf{Recommendation 2}:  A series of workshops on enabling the technologies be held.  Each of the major R\&D tasks should generate a list of  goals with quantitative metrics,  timelines and required resources.   Activities requiring global collaboration and coordination should be laid down and pathways identified.
\item \textbf{Recommendation 3}:  international consortia should be formed to work on key problems with industry partners; establish leadership and organization structure with teeth (ie controls purse strings); and seek funding via common proposal submitted across funding agencies.
\item \textbf{Recommendation 4}: Over the next 5 years mature 2G enabling technologies should be demonstrated to be ready for application in 3G facilities. (Should we say  1 micron, fused silica, room temperature??).
\end{itemize}

An overview of required timelines to reach installation maturity is depicted in figure \ref{fig:maturity}. The figure shows required technical readiness levels for the various subsystems, depending on the foreseen time of installation and anticipated lead times. Infrastructure and facilities naturally will have to reach maturity earliest, followed by the other subsystems in the sequence of installation. The timings for the lower technical readiness levels TR1 - TR3 (relative to the highest level TR4) depend on the duration required between the individual steps, e.g. once technical readiness is achieved for core optics it still takes a few years to demonstrate full scale prototypes and manufacture the final optics substrates. Despite considerable differences for the different observatories (like ET and CE), large variations within the subsystems and an inevitable uncertainty in timelines, we summarise the timelines  for each subsystem in a single bar in figure \ref{fig:maturity}, except for simulation and control. Simulation capabilities are required early in the planning process, while control systems need to be ready for implementation only when the detector subsystems are installed.  

The resources required to reach operational readiness are roughly divided into \textit{low, mid} and \textit{high}, with indicative financial investments for R\&D for the various subsystems %ranging from less than 5 M€,\$ to more than 50M€,\$ 
over the entire period from now to installation. 

The highest costs are expected for the developing capabilities to manufacture the main optics (presumably fused silica and silicon) and for the development of coatings and coating facilities. 
Producing ultra-pure optics substrates of approx. 200\,kg weight requires an international effort and tight collaboration with industry. Developing coatings of outstanding optical quality and uniformity over the whole mirror surface, combined with the required low mechanical losses at  room temperature and cryogenic temperatures is currently regarded as the biggest hurdle to overcome for building 3G gravitational wave observatories. International collaboration and building redundancy in coating capabilities is essential for success.

In particular for underground infrastructures and facilities, R\&D will incur significant costs for exploration and prototyping. Exploratory efforts have already been started at the ET candidate sites. In the construction phase building the infrastructure and facilities will be the biggest cost items and consequently have the largest cost saving potential. R\&D efforts to minimise costs while satisfying the strict technical demands is mandatory.


\magentacomment{Josh: Here I pasted some remarks from quantum noise that Dave suggested be moved to general considerations.} 

\begin{itemize}
\item National funding agencies to increase funding (staff and instrumentation) of the relevant lab activities and to enable the required long-term research programmes at the relevant prototype interferometers.
\greencomment{Dave: Certainly.  But this is a generic recommendation in the sense that all R\&D 3G efforts need more R\&D funding.  I don't think this needs to be here (or in any other chapter), but somewhere in the main set of recommendations.}
\item Existing GW collaborations to take ownership of 3G R\&D and integrate it into their programs and deliverables, in order to ensure sufficient support for the long-term future of the field (as it has been done so successfully for 2G R\&D during the operation of the initial detectors). 
\item Establishment of worldwide discussion and coordination forum (meeting several times a year) across all relevant collaborations, in order to stipulate exchange of ideas and allowing (if deemed useful) for a coordination of the person-power intensive experimental activities.
\end{itemize}
