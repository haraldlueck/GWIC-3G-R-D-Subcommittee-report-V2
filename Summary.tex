\magentacomment{Josh: Here I pasted some remarks from quantum noise that Dave suggested be moved to general considerations.} 

\begin{itemize}
\item National funding agencies to increase funding (staff and instrumentation) of the relevant lab activities and to enable the required long-term research programmes at the relevant prototype interferometers.
\greencomment{Dave: Certainly.  But this is a generic recommendation in the sense that all R\&D 3G efforts need more R\&D funding.  I don't think this needs to be here (or in any other chapter), but somewhere in the main set of recommendations.}
\item Existing GW collaborations to take ownership of 3G R\&D and integrate it into their programs and deliverables, in order to ensure sufficient support for the long-term future of the field (as it has been done so successfully for 2G R\&D during the operation of the initial detectors). 
\item Establishment of worldwide discussion and coordination forum (meeting several times a year) across all relevant collaborations, in order to stipulate exchange of ideas and allowing (if deemed useful) for a coordination of the person-power intensive experimental activities.
\end{itemize}
